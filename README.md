# **Scanning Setup Utility**
## The Basics

The exe is compiled with PS2EXE from the source available here.

This script completely setups the user environment to allow a quick scan to SMB setup

This includes:
- Creating or updating the scans user account
- Creating the scans folder at **C:\scans** (by default)
- Setting local permissions for the scans folder
- Sharing the scans folder via SMB as ***scans*** (by default)
- Setting SMB permissions for the SMB share
- Creating a desktop shortcut to the scans folder

All you have to do is run scans.exe and follow the prompts, it's as easy as that.
