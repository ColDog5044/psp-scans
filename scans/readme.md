# **Scanning Setup Utility**
*V1.3.0.0*

## The Basics

The exe is compiled with PS2EXE from the source available here.

This script completely setups the user environment to allow a quick scan to SMB setup

This includes:
- Creating or updating the scans user account
- Creating the scans folder at **C:\scans**
- Setting local permissions for **C:\scans**
- Sharing **C:\scans** as ***scans*** on the network
- Setting SMB permissions for the ***scans*** share
- Creating a desktop shortcut to **C:\scans**

All you have to do is run scans.exe and follow the prompts, it's as easy as that.
